# 4D change analysis of near-continuous LiDAR time series for applications in geomorphic monitoring

A short course on 4D change analysis offered at the Virtual Geoscience Conference 2023 (https://vgc-series.org/) by [Katharina Anders](https://www.professoren.tum.de/anders-katharina), [Roderik Lindenbergh](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/geoscience-remote-sensing/staff/scientific-staff/dr-rc-roderik-lindenbergh), and [Mieke Kuschnerus](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/geoscience-remote-sensing/staff/phd-students/m-mieke-kuschnerus).

This short course introduces the acquisition and processing of 4D point clouds (theory), and presents methods to handle, explore, and visualize the data (hands-on) in a first part. The second part will feature time series-based methods of analyzing 4D point clouds (theory and hands-on), demonstrating how the temporal information in these data can be used to identify and assess occurrences and patterns of different surface activities in a scene. Notably, we introduce time series clustering and the extraction of 4D objects-by-change. The test dataset is a laser scanning time series of a sandy beach. Hands-on is performed with Python (basic skills required), where methods are available in the open-source library py4dgeo.

_The course is based on material of the [E-TRAINEE course](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/etrainee) by the [E-TRAINEE Development Team (2023)](#references). Find all details on the project in [Potůčková et al. (2023)](#references)._

# Prerequisites

Basic skills in programming and Python are required. 

Knowledge on principles of point cloud acquisition and processing are recommended. If required, suitable preparation material is provided by the E-TRAINEE course [here](https://3dgeo-heidelberg.github.io/etrainee/module3/01_pointcloud_principles/01_pointcloud_principles.html) ([E-TRAINEE Development Team (2023)](#references)).

# Software

## Python

The recommended practice to set up Python for this course, is to [create a Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) with all required modules (packages). Instructions for installation on various platforms are available in the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/).

If you are using Conda, you may use the following procedure to create the Python environment `vgc2023` from the file vgc2023.yml in [course\assets\python_envs](https://github.com/tum-rsa/vgc2023-shortcourse-4d/tree/main/course/assets/python_envs):

```
conda env create -f vgc2023.yml
```

## CloudCompare

CloudCompare is an open-source 3D point cloud processing software. Download and install CloudCompare from the official website: http://www.cloudcompare.org/

We recommend to use the latest stable release.

Help for using CloudCompare can be found in the documentation: https://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php/Main_Page


# Data

The course uses a time series of hourly point clouds acquired with permanent laser scanning (PLS) at a sandy beach by [Vos et al., 2022](#references). The full dataset is openly available on [this PANGAEA data repository](https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.934058) ([Vos et al., 2021](#references)).

An extract of this dataset to be used in this course is provided by E-TRAINEE (E-TRAINEE Development Team, 2023): https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10003574 (module3.zip)

Additionally, a time series of annual airborne laser scanning (ALS) data of the area is provided here: http://doris.tudelft.nl/~rlindenbergh/vgc/ (courtesy of the Dutch Public Works)
